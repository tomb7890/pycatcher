What is the goal?

The goal is to get pycatcher under github.

What is the obstacle?

The code is unstructured and ad hoc. 

describe the code to me. 

main()

first thing is parsing of command line arguments. 
  ** TODO: replace ad-hoc with optparse **

  ** TODO: study optparse! **

ok, then create a subscritions object, which encapsulates/parses an
ini file storing program information.
