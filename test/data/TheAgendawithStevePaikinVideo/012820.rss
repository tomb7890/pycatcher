      <itunes:subtitle>Drive 60 kilometres north of Toronto and you'll find the Town of Innisfil. In terms of area, it's roughly the size of Mississauga, but with less than one-twentieth of the population. Late last year, a new GO station in the town got its funding, and with it, an opportunity to build something innovative-and to redefine what Innisfil looks like. To outline the new "Orbit" project, we welcome: Lynn Dollin, mayor of Innisfil; and Jason Reynar, the town's chief administrative officer.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>A Wealth Tax in Canada?</title>
      <itunes:author>TVO | Steve Paikin</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>According to a 2018 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives report, the wealthiest 87 families in Canada have as much wealth as the bottom 12 million Canadians. In the fall federal election, the NDP proposed a 1 per cent wealth tax for families with assets over $20 million, which would include approximately 6,000 families. Is a wealth tax fair? Would it be effective, or do more harm than good? The Agenda examines both sides of the argument.</itunes:subtitle>

      <itunes:subtitle>Are billionaires such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates the American Dream personified? Do they reflect a healthy economy?

      <title>The Breast Screening Debate</title>
      <itunes:author>TVO | Steve Paikin</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>Earlier this year, The Agenda featured an interview with journalist Renee Pellerin about her new book, ,Conspiracy of Hope., The gist of the book is that too many women are going for unnecessary mammograms. It was a controversial book and prompted a dissenting email to the show from Dr. Paula Gordon, a clinical professor in the radiology department at the University of British Columbia, and senior radiologist at the Sadie Diamond Breast Program at B.C. Women's Hospital and Health Care.  So, in the interest of equal time, The Agenda welcomes Dr. Gordon for the other side of the debate.</itunes:subtitle>

      <title>Malcolm Gladwell: Rethinking Familiarity</title>
      <itunes:author>TVO | Steve Paikin</itunes:author>
      <itunes:subtitle>On any given day, much of our communication is with people we don't know, or don't know well. Those interactions can sometimes be fraught with misunderstandings and misreading. Author, podcaster, and thought experimentalist Malcolm Gladwell has taken this idea and run with it in his first book in six years, "Talking to Strangers: What We Should Know About the People We Don't Know." Gladwell lays out social science research, applies it to current events and asks readers to rethink anything from police checks to Amanda Knox, Bernie Madoff, campus sexual assault, and terrorist interrogations. He talks to Steve Paikin about why we can't trust what we think we know when we meet unfamiliar people.</itunes:subtitle>
