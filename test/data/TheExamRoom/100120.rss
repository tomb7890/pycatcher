			<description><![CDATA[<p>Eric Adams woke up one morning and could not see. Fearful that he was going blind, he rushed to his doctor’s office where he was diagnosed with diabetes. He was told to accept that he would suffer from poor vision for the rest of his life. But Eric, a former New York City police officer, decided to open an investigation into his health to find a better way. He searched for evidence, combed through clues, and finally cracked the case. It was food that put him in this position and it was food that would get him out of it.</p> <p> </p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room, <a href= "https://twitter.com/healthyatlastbk">Eric Adams</a> joins <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> to share how he became healthy at last.</p> <p> </p> <p>After recovering his own health, he began helping others, including his mother who was in her 80’s when she began eating a plant-based diet. Like her son, the change made a dramatic improvement to her health as well! Eric is also the president of the borough of Brooklyn in New York and was instrumental in bringing plant-based meals to children by creating the Meatless Mondays program in the public school system.</p> <p> </p> <p>He is now sharing his story nationwide with the release of his book <a href="https://amzn.to/3kMDSXx">Healthy at Last: A Plant-Based Approach to Preventing and Reversing Diabetes and Other Chronic Illnesses</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>Also on the show, Dr. Neal Barnard discusses the top 5 co-morbidities associated with COVID-19 and how changes in diet and lifestyle can help improve and even reverse them!</p> <p> </p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Eric Adams</strong></p> <p>Book: <a href= "https://amzn.to/3kMDSXx">https://amzn.to/3kMDSXx</a></p> <p>Previous Interview: <a href= "https://apple.co/33hGhSt">https://apple.co/33hGhSt</a></p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "https://twitter.com/healthyatlastbk">@healthyatlastbk</a></p> <p> — — —</p> <p><strong>Chuck Carroll</strong></p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a></p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href= "https://wghtloss.cc/ChuckFacebook">https://wghtloss.cc/ChuckFacebook</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Dr. Neal Barnard</strong></p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/drnealbarnard">@drnealbarnard</a></p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/drnealbarnard/">@drnealbarnard</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href= "http://bit.ly/DrBarnardFB">http://bit.ly/DrBarnardFB</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Physicians Committee</strong></p> <p>Twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a></p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee/">@PhysiciansCommittee</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href= "https://wghtloss.cc/PCRMFacebook">https://wghtloss.cc/PCRMFacebook</a></p> <p>YouTube: <a href= "https://bit.ly/PCRMYouTube">https://bit.ly/PCRMYouTube</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Barnard Medical Center Telemedicine</strong></p> <p>Schedule Appointment</p> <p><a href= "https://bit.ly/BMCtelemed">https://bit.ly/BMCtelemed</a></p> <p>202-527-7500</p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Share the Show</strong></p> <p>Please subscribe and give the show a 5-star rating on <a href= "http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-exam-room-by-the-physicians-committee/id1312957138"> Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/6XElJTfdDQLQBd8Wm5BeOv?si=ImSV8rgHSXGOJvbEICIpTA"> Spotify</a> or many other podcast providers.

He would often order three Big Macs at a time to satisfy an insatiable appetite for fast food.</p> <p> </p> <p>Worried that his health would soon fail, Richard’s doctor prescribed medication for high blood pressure. Not wanting to trade pills for another trip through the drive-thru, he challenged his doctor to allow him to hold off on taking the prescription.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Is it possible for someone who eats a healthy vegan diet to become infected with the coronavirus? As much as you may wish to say no, the fact is that no diet can offer immunity to COVID-19. However, a healthy diet may still make a huge difference in the outcome of the case.</p> <p> </p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://ericandpeety.com/">Eric O’Grey</a> joins “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll to share his experience with COVID-19. At one point Eric weighed 340 pounds and was on 15 different medications. Doctors even told him that he would die if he didn’t change his ways. He began eating a vegan diet and with the help of a loving dog, Peety, whom he adopted from a local shelter, began to lose weight and reclaim his health. He says that going vegan saved his life once. Now, after getting COVID-19 he thinks it may have saved it for a second time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Eric also speaks about mother-in-law who didn’t begin eating a plant-based diet until she was 96 and in poor health. Within weeks of making the change doctors took Josephine off of all her medication and she began walking  2 to 3 miles every day!

Within weeks of making the change doctors took Josephine off of all her medication and she began walking  2 to 3 miles every day! She is proof that it is never too late to get healthy!</p> <p> </p> <p>Also on the show, <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/NealBarnardMD/">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> and <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/james-f-loomis-md-mba"> Dr. Jim Loomis</a> answer your questions!</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Is it healthy to eat oatmeal for breakfast every day?</li> <li>Will pureeing beans reduce the amount of fiber they have?</li> <li>Is it better to eat nuts raw or roasted?</li> <li>Tips for someone with osteoporosis who is going vegan?</li> <li>Many more</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Barnard will be speaking at the <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/icnm">International Conference on Nutrition in Medicine</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Kim Williams takes a new look at the racial disparities of the coronavirus as he joins The Exam Room™ podcast. If the playing field were equal, African Americans would essentially be at no higher risk of COVID-19, according to Williams. However, as it stands now, Blacks are dying at a rate nearly 2.5 times greater than Asians and Whites and at even higher levels in some areas. What then is causing the staggering differences?</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Williams, chief of cardiology at Rush University and former president of the American College of Cardiology, examines those factors, including systemic racism, as he joins <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc">"The Weight Loss Champion" Chuck Carroll</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>He also discusses research that finds once data models have been adjusted to account for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol, race does not play a significant factor in the risk of COVID-19 related deaths or severity of cases. Additionally, Dr. Williams and Chuck talk about the role diet can play in mitigating those risks and how those with limited means can adopt a plant-based diet. Thus, their chances of developing severe symptoms of COVID-19 would decrease.</p> <p> </p> <p>Plus, Chuck is joined by Laura Sainz who shares her remarkable journey back to health. Laura was thriving professionally in the corporate world, but also living in constant pain after developing Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia, arthritis and other chronic conditions prior to the age of 25. Tired of living an unhealthy life, she began to explore her health but it wasn’t until she adopted a fully vegan diet that her pain dissipated.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Do milk and dairy belong in the same category as tobacco and processed meat?</p> <p> </p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, health benefits of dairy are debated as renowned epidemiologist Dr. Gary Fraser joins <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc">"The Weight Loss Champion" Chuck Carroll</a>. Does cheese or a glass of milk increase the risk for cancer and chronic disease or are they the cornerstones of a healthy diet? Some of the research being discussed may be counter to what many who subscribe to a plant-based diet believe.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Fraser served as the director of the Adventist health studies at Loma Linda for 32 years and was heavily involved in the Adventist Health Study-1 as well as the development of the Adventist Health Study-2.</p> <p> </p> <p>Chuck also explores other research that shows dairy can be more nefarious when it comes to your health as he revisits a conversation with oncology nutritionist <a href= "https://www.wholesomellc.com/">Alison Tierney</a>. She strongly recommends eliminating dairy as eating a whole food plant-based diet has been shown to be one of the best preventative measures for cancer and other chronic diseases. <a href= "https://bit.ly/3gv7WoD">Alison</a>, whose mother is a breast cancer survivor, discusses the link between dairy fat and estrogen as well as the production of other potentially cancer-causing hormones such as 5alpha-P and IGF-1.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Fraser will be a featured speaker at the upcoming <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/icnm">International Conference on Nutrition in Medicine</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>ICNM</strong></p> <p>Register: <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/icnm">https://www.pcrm.org/icnm</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Associations of Dairy Study</strong></p> <p><a href="https://bit.ly/3f36LMR">https://bit.ly/3f36LMR</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Alison Tierney</strong></p> <p><a href= "https://www.wholesomellc.com">https://www.wholesomellc.com</a></p> <p>PCOS Journey: <a href= "https://bit.ly/3gv7WoD">https://bit.ly/3gv7WoD</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Chuck Carroll</strong></p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a></p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Physicians Committee</strong></p> <p>Twitter: <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a></p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee/">@PhysiciansCommittee</a></p> <p>Facebook: <a href= "https://wghtloss.cc/PCRMFacebook">https://wghtloss.cc/PCRMFacebook</a></p> <p>YouTube: <a href= "https://bit.ly/PCRMYouTube">https://bit.ly/PCRMYouTube</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Barnard Medical Center Telemedicine</strong></p> <p>Schedule Appointment: <a href= "https://bit.ly/BMCtelemed">https://bit.ly/BMCtelemed</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Share the Show</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Please subscribe and give the show a 5-star rating on <a href= "http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-exam-room-by-the-physicians-committee/id1312957138"> Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/6XElJTfdDQLQBd8Wm5BeOv?si=ImSV8rgHSXGOJvbEICIpTA"> Spotify</a> or many other podcast providers.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are fearful that if a disease runs in the family we will get it and there is nothing that we can do. It’s as if our fate is already sealed.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, on this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc">"The Weight Loss Champion" Chuck Carroll</a> is joined by <a href= "https://www.rootedgreenwellness.com/">Jill Erickson</a> and her husband Joel whose stories are proof that doesn’t have to be the case. Colon cancer runs deeply in Jill’s family — her mom, aunt, and cousin all had it. When it hit particularly close to home she turned to her husband, Joel, and said that she knew that she would die from it as well and that it was only a matter of time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then something happened one Sunday afternoon. Armed with a big bowl of snacks and the tv remote, she sat down on the couch expecting to burn brain cells and get a few hours closer to an inescapable diagnosis. Instead, she stumbled across a certain documentary on Netflix and began learning about the benefits of a plant-based diet. Suddenly, she realized that her family history of cancer did not have to be her destiny.</p> <p> </p> <p>The importance of nutrition became even more paramount when Joel suffered a “widow maker” heart attack.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Many of us are fearful that if a disease runs in the family we will get it and there is nothing that we can do. It’s as if our fate is already sealed.</p> <p> </p> <p>However, on this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc">"The Weight Loss Champion" Chuck Carroll</a> is joined by <a href= "https://www.rootedgreenwellness.com/">Jill Erickson</a> and her husband Joel whose stories are proof that doesn’t have to be the case. Colon cancer runs deeply in Jill’s family — her mom, aunt, and cousin all had it. When it hit particularly close to home she turned to her husband, Joel, and said that she knew that she would die from it as well and that it was only a matter of time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Then something happened one Sunday afternoon. Armed with a big bowl of snacks and the tv remote, she sat down on the couch expecting to burn brain cells and get a few hours closer to an inescapable diagnosis. Instead, she stumbled across a certain documentary on Netflix and began learning about the benefits of a plant-based diet. Suddenly, she realized that her family history of cancer did not have to be her destiny.</p> <p> </p> <p>The importance of nutrition became even more paramount when Joel suffered a “widow maker” heart attack. That is when they pledged to take their plant-based lifestyle to a new level and have never looked back. They are now even teaching cooking classes and passing along what she has learned through their company Rooted Green Wellness and the Food For Life program.</p> <p> </p> <p>This is a story of love, triumph, health, and revelations.</p> <p> </p> <p>Plus, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NealBarnardMD/">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> answers a question from someone new to eating a vegan diet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Nine years ago Bruce Mylrea was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

While many others struggled, Bruce and Mindy never really left the honeymoon phase and are still like a couple of newlyweds! Her book centers on her research on how a plant-based diet can improve male performance.</p> <p> </p> <p>Also, Chuck revisits a conversation with Dr. Steve Neabore about the science of erectile dysfunction which plagues 40% of all men over 40, according to some estimates!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>For people with diabetes the risk of becoming gravely ill if infected by the coronavirus is far higher than nearly everyone else.</p> <p> </p> <p>But there are certain foods and steps they can take to help mitigate the threat and stay healthy during the global pandemic. On this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> is joined by <a href= "https://www.masteringdiabetes.org/team/">Dr. Cyrus Khambatta</a> to learn about the ways diabetics can boost their immune system to help fight the coronavirus.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Khambatta, who lives with type 1 diabetes, outlines the specific immune boosting foods and how their nutrients can be beneficial. He also details the different forms of immunity.</p> <p> </p> <p>According to Khambatta, cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and cauliflower along with green leafy vegetables can pack an immune boosting punch.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/jia-xu">Dr. Jia Xu</a> also checks in from Beijing for another update on how life is progressing in the country that had been the epicenter for the coronavirus outbreak. He shares with Chuck some of the strategies being implemented as thousands return to work following weeks of sheltering in place.</p> <p> </p> <p>If you would like to submit a question for the doctor please tweet <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> or <a href="https://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a> using the hashtag #ExamRoomPodcast.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/telemedicine">Schedule a telemedicine appointment</a> with doctors and dietitians at Barnard Medical Center.

If processed meat such as bacon and hot dogs is classified by the World Health Organization as class 1 carcinogens, why isn’t it listed on the state of California’s list of known carcinogens? By law, the state is required to maintain “a list of chemicals known to the state to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity.”</p> <p>Mark is here to talk about a lawsuit filed against the state that would force it to add processed meats to that list!</p> <p>Book an appointment to visit Dr. Rahman at the <a href= "http://bit.ly/BMCappt">Barnard Medical Center</a> in Washington, DC.</p> <p>Join Chuck, Dr. Neal Barnard and more than a dozen other nutrition experts for the <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/events/immersion">Plant-Based Immersion</a> on May 8-9 at the Grand Hyatt Washington.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Food can play a significant role in determining whether or not a woman will get breast cancer.</p> <p>It is estimated that more than 250,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with it this year, but on this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> is joined by <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/yourbodyinbalance">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> who will teach you what you need to know to greatly reduce the risk of being one of them. Dr. Barnard will share the science of food, hormones and breast health from his book <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/yourbodyinbalance">Your Body In Balance</a><em>.</em></p> <p>You will learn how fat, meat, dairy and other factors can increase the chances of developing breast cancer and the best diet and foods to lower the risk.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It is possible to find relief for hot flashes and menstrual cramps by making simple changes to your diet.</p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room Podcast, two women who were pushed to the limit share how they were able to overcome severe hot flashes and unbearable menstrual cramping with food. Plus, <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> is joined by <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/yourbodyinbalance">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> who explains why certain foods can trigger these conditions and how the hormones that cause them can be tamed at the dinner table.</p> <p>Ann Friday felt like a prisoner in her heavily layered police uniform when hot flashes would strike. Underneath layers of clothing and a thick bullet proof vest she roasted as the sweltering heat became trapped on her body with no way of escape. She would lose sleep as hot flashes indiscriminately flared up in the middle of the night. The rude awakening jeopardized her focus on the street, presenting a potentially dangerous situation. Having tried everything, she finally found a way to cool off and calm the hot flashes by making one big change.</p> <p>Lindsay Nixon would be doubled over in crippling pain every month when. The cramps were so severe that she was unable to leave her home. Often she begged her roommate to stand on her belly or would fold herself over the back of the couch thinking that the pressure would bring relief. She also began taking prescription pain killers and considered having a hysterectomy at a young age. The decision would have taken away her ability to have children, but all she could think about was putting an end to her agony. Finally, she found that food was the answer.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Can endometriosis be treated by changing your diet?</p> <p>In the fourth episode of the special “Your Body In Balance” series, you’ll hear from <a href= "https://www.foodsavedme.com/classes">Katherine Lawrence Ireland</a> whose surgeon stopped a hysterectomy mid-procedure after discovering that her endometriosis had improved so dramatically that it had practically vanished. Doctors called it a miracle, but Katherine believed it was because she changed her diet weeks earlier.</p> <p>So how could this have happened? Was it really the new foods that she had been eating that caused her endometriosis to improve?</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> welcomes <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/yourbodyinbalance">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> to the show get the answers. Dr. Barnard explains the nutrition science of why that “miracle” occurred in the operating room. He also details how a diet that is heavy on meat and dairy, but light on fruits and vegetables, can cause hormonal issues and fuel endometriosis.</p> <p>It was a condition that nearly robbed Katherine of the opportunity to have children. Today, she is the proud mom of three boys!</p> <p>Katherine has also devoted her life to helping others leading healthier lives as well.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This episode of The Exam Room™ podcast is all about debunking the “bro science” that is spread in gyms and locker rooms worldwide. An increasing amount of science shows that athletes are actually able to perform as well — if not better — when eating a plant based diet!</p> <p>Of course that idea is counter to the low-carb, meat-heavy diets that the majority of athletes have been taught to swear by. The idea of going without beef and chicken is mind-boggling for most competitors. Yet, research shows the only thing mind-boggling is why anyone would still be turning to meat in hopes of becoming an All-Star.</p> <p>When the Super Bowl kicks off millions of people will be tuning in to see the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers clash on the gridiron with an NFL Championship on the line. And many of those watching might be a little vegan curious thanks to the release of <em>The Game Changers</em> documentary.</p> <p>The number of players in the NFL who are turning to a plant-based diet to gain an edge is rising. For Chiefs star safety Tyrann Mathieu the decision is paying off handsomely. He recorded the second-highest interception total of his career this season and earned first-team All-Pro honors. But it’s not just his on-field performance that’s getting a lift. His accolades earned him a lucrative multi-million dollar contract last off-season. And now he’s playing for a championship!</p> <p>But what is it about plants that is so attractive to these gargantuan athletes? That’s what we’re going to find out on this episode.</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> is joined Barnard Medical Center director <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/james-f-loomis-md-mba"> Dr. Jim Loomis</a> who was featured in the smash hit documentary The Game Changers. He also is a former team physician for both an NFL team and Major League Baseball club. Now, Dr. Loomis is fueling his practice exclusively on plants and delving into the science that’s giving players like Mathieu a leg up on the competition!</p> <p>Why is it that they’re able to recover faster? Do plants actually make you run faster? Can they still perform at elite levels? And can the common athlete and weekend warriors benefit as well? Dr. Loomis has the answers.</p> <p>Plus, Audrey Dunham joins the show with some amazing plant-based recipes just in time for kickoff.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>The doctor told him that he would need to be on insulin to treat diabetes for the rest of his life. But he told the doctor that wouldn’t work for him. Soon thereafter Bob Blackburn became the first patient the doctor had ever seen to reverse a diabetes diagnosis.</p> <p>The idea of ditching meat and dairy was once unfathomable to the former Marine and professional wrestler. For decades his diet consisted of fast food, junk food, and high-fat foods. In fact, while traveling he would plan his routes around his favorite high-calorie restaurants.</p> <p>But an inner health warrior was awoken inside Bob when his doctor informed him that he had diabetes. From then on, the unfathomable plant-based diet became the only diet he was interested in. </p> <p>On this third installment of the “Your Body In Balance” series with <a href="https://www.pcrm.org/yourbodyinbalance">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> and <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a>, Bob shares his remarkable journey—one filled with a lifetime of adventure, learning, and inspiration.</p> <p>Dr. Barnard also sits down with Chuck to explore the connection between diabetes and hormones and why a dietary change can be just what the doctor ordered.</p> <p>Bob’s story is just one of the many featured in Dr. Barnard’s new book, <a href="http://bit.ly/bodybalancebook">Your Body In Balance</a>, which will be released on Feb. 4.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Order The Book</strong></p> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/2ZYYfaU">https://amzn.to/2ZYYfaU</a></p> <p><strong>About The Book</strong></p> <p><a href= "http://bit.ly/bodybalancebook">http://bit.ly/bodybalancebook</a></p> <p>In Your Body in Balance, Dr. Barnard describes how food and hormones play a powerful role in:</p> <p>- Fertility and menopause: Learn how foods affect the hormones that play a role in fertility, premenstrual syndrome, endometriosis, menstrual cramps, and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you have been struggling with your skin and battling acne and nothing seems to make it go away, the solution could be getting your hormones back in balance!</p> <p>As we begin our special series “Your Body In Balance” with Dr. Neal Barnard and <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> the pair are joined by twin sisters Nina and Randa Nelson whose struggle with acne led to bouts of depression and took a toll on both the budding entertainers’ careers. During bad flare ups they would shut themselves inside their home and shut out their friends and the outside world. It seemed as though pimples would plague them their entire lives and that all hope was lost. That is until they changed what their diet.</p> <p>On this episode, Dr. Barnard explains why our hormones are affected by food and how if what we eat causes them to go haywire, the solution to healthier skin might begin at the table.</p> <p>Their story is just one of many featured in Dr. Barnard’s new book, <a href="http://bit.ly/bodybalancebook">Your Body In Balance</a> which will be released February 4.</p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>Order The Book</strong></p> <p><a href= "https://amzn.to/2ZYYfaU">https://amzn.to/2ZYYfaU</a></p> <p>— — —</p> <p><strong>About The Book</strong></p> <p><a href= "http://bit.ly/bodybalancebook">http://bit.ly/bodybalancebook</a></p> <p> </p> <p>In Your Body in Balance, Dr. Barnard describes how food and hormones play a powerful role in:</p> <p>- Fertility and menopause: Learn how foods affect the hormones that play a role in fertility, premenstrual syndrome, endometriosis, menstrual cramps, and polycystic ovarian syndrome.

			<title>Everything You Need To Know About Going Vegan with Drs. Michael Greger, Neal Barnard, Jasmol Sardana</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Everything you need to know about going vegan you will learn in this show as Drs. Michael Greger, Neal Barnard and Jasmol Sardana join “<a href="http://wghtloss.cc/ChuckFacebook">The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> on The Exam Room™!</p> <p>This jam-packed show will help you make this the healthiest year of your life.</p> <p>Dr. Greger will share how <em>not</em> to diet! At a time when we’re spending billions of dollars every year to lose weight only to get heavier and heavier, Dr. Greger clues us in on where we’re going wrong as he talks about his new book, <a href= "https://amzn.to/2tn1EUA">How Not To Diet</a>.

			<title>The 5 Biggest Stories Of 2019</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What a year 2019 has been! Evidence showing the link between disease and diet continues to mount, which means that researchers are more confident than ever that key to leading a long and healthy life begins with the food on our plate.</p> <p> </p> <p>On this very special edition of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> looks back at the five biggest stories on the show from the past year.</p> <p> </p> <p>5.) The final 365 days of the decade were dominated by questions about the health and complexion of our skin and the foods that help keep us looking young and vibrant. Plant-based dermatologist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dr_vegan/">Dr. Niyati Sharma</a> was kind enough to offer advice on everything from dry skin to wrinkles to acne!</p> <p> </p> <p>4.) 2019 was also the year of the vegan athlete with the release of <em><a href="http://gamechangersmovie.com/">The Game Changers</a></em> documentary. Elite athletes in virtually every major sport are now turning to a plant-based diet to get a leg up on their competition. Everyone from tennis phenom Venus Williams to NBA superstar Kyrie Irving and Formula 1 Racing champion Lewis Hamilton are ditching meat and dairy to take their game to the next level. <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/james-f-loomis-md-mba"> Dr. Jim Loomis</a>, a former team internist in the NFL and Major League Baseball, joined Chuck to explain what their new diets are doing to give their body a big boost!</p> <p> </p> <p>3.) The year also saw renewed scrutiny of dairy. It’s been said for decades that milk does a body good, but newly released studies have shown that its effects are doing far more harm than help. Oncology dietitian <a href= "https://www.wholesomellc.com/about-alison">Alison Tierney</a> joined the show to present data showing rather than promoting healthy teeth and strong bones, the proteins and fat in dairy are actually promoting cancer!</p> <p> </p> <p>2.) 2019 will soon give way to 2020 and before we know it the calendar will reset to 2021 and then 2022. An undeniable truth is that time marches on and we all grow older. Aging is a natural part of life, but can also be one of the most stressful. Many of us fear memories beginning to fade with time as forgetfulness creeps in and worries of Alzheimer’s disease enter our mind. But <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/NealBarnardMD/">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joined Chuck with powerful research showing that we can give our brains a big boost! All it takes is a willingness to make small changes and eliminate certain foods from our diet and replacing them with major memory enhancing nutrients! Dr. Barnard has the science behind it all!</p> <p> </p> <p>1.) The most popular show of the year focused on a problem that we all will face at some point in our life, food addiction. What is it about certain food that makes it impossible to put the fork down? Why are we compulsively driven to eat even when we’re not hungry? Dr. Barnard returned for a fascinating conversation with Chuck, a recovering food addict himself, to show exactly how our brains are wired to get hooked on high fat and sugary foods. In fact, the addiction can be so strong that the same medication used to treat opioid overdoses can be used to curb chocolate cravings!</p> <p> </p> <p>— — —</p> <p>Dr. Barnard Chuck will both be speaking at <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/events/kickstart-intensive">The Kickstart Intensive</a> on January 10-11 in Washington, DC!</p> <p> </p> <p>Special offer for Exam Room listeners!

Everyone from tennis phenom Venus Williams to NBA superstar Kyrie Irving and Formula 1 Racing champion Lewis Hamilton are ditching meat and dairy to take their game to the next level. <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/james-f-loomis-md-mba"> Dr. Jim Loomis</a>, a former team internist in the NFL and Major League Baseball, joined Chuck to explain what their new diets are doing to give their body a big boost!</p> <p> </p> <p>3.) The year also saw renewed scrutiny of dairy. It’s been said for decades that milk does a body good, but newly released studies have shown that its effects are doing far more harm than help. Oncology dietitian <a href= "https://www.wholesomellc.com/about-alison">Alison Tierney</a> joined the show to present data showing rather than promoting healthy teeth and strong bones, the proteins and fat in dairy are actually promoting cancer!</p> <p> </p> <p>2.) 2019 will soon give way to 2020 and before we know it the calendar will reset to 2021 and then 2022. An undeniable truth is that time marches on and we all grow older. Aging is a natural part of life, but can also be one of the most stressful. Many of us fear memories beginning to fade with time as forgetfulness creeps in and worries of Alzheimer’s disease enter our mind. But <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/NealBarnardMD/">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joined Chuck with powerful research showing that we can give our brains a big boost! All it takes is a willingness to make small changes and eliminate certain foods from our diet and replacing them with major memory enhancing nutrients! Dr. Barnard has the science behind it all!</p> <p> </p> <p>1.) The most popular show of the year focused on a problem that we all will face at some point in our life, food addiction. What is it about certain food that makes it impossible to put the fork down? Why are we compulsively driven to eat even when we’re not hungry? Dr. Barnard returned for a fascinating conversation with Chuck, a recovering food addict himself, to show exactly how our brains are wired to get hooked on high fat and sugary foods. In fact, the addiction can be so strong that the same medication used to treat opioid overdoses can be used to curb chocolate cravings!</p> <p> </p> <p>— — —</p> <p>Dr. Barnard Chuck will both be speaking at <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/events/kickstart-intensive">The Kickstart Intensive</a> on January 10-11 in Washington, DC!</p> <p> </p> <p>Special offer for Exam Room listeners!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>This is a jam-packed show with healthy holiday wisdom and a visit from Audrey and Jeff Dunham!</p> <p>It’s the most wonderful time of year… for gyms to sell memberships, and fad diet “gurus” to cash-in. It’s also a wonderful time for your sweet tooth with cookies and cakes tempting you everywhere you turn.</p> <p>But it’s not the most wonderful time of year for your scale or your health. Overindulging and putting on weight has become as much of a part of the holidays as opening gifts. But what if there was a way to make holiday treats with less fat and fewer calories?</p> <p>There is! And many of the plant-based options are so good that even naughty kids who leave them for Santa get bumped to the nice list.</p> <p>Join “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll and dietitian Lee Crosby as they share healthier holiday secrets and recipes during a live broadcast from the Fruitive Restaurant in Washington, DC! Learn the best plant-based substitutes for eggs and oil, the nutritional benefits of oatmeal cookies, and how to lower cholesterol while still catering to your sweet tooth!</p> <p>Plus, learn how to deal with social situations at parties and family gatherings from non-vegans and how to plant ahead when you know vegan options will be limited.</p> <p>You won’t want to miss the recipes for the <a href= "http://bit.ly/oatchocchip">oatmeal raisin chocolate chip cookies</a> and <a href= "https://wghtloss.cc/chocbanbread">chocolate lover’s banana bread</a>.</p> <p>Then, Chuck is joined in Los Angeles by famed comedian Jeff Dunham and his plant-powered cookie creating wife, Audrey. They share how Jeff keeps it plant-based on the road, an unforgettable Thanksgiving experience with the non-vegan side of the family, and the trick to finding healthy vegan options in the last places you’d expect! Plus, Audrey unveils her new cinnamon oatmeal cookies from Peanuts Bake Shop just in time for the holidays. And you’ll hear about Jeff’s adventures taking cookies out of the oven on his tour bus as it barrels down the road at 70 miles per hour.</p> <p>Lee and Chuck will both be speaking at <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/events/kickstart-intensive">The Kickstart Intensive</a> on January 10-11 in Washington, DC!</p> <p>Special offer for Exam Room listeners!

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Could eating a vegan diet be the key to treating Crohn’s Disease? Quite possibly.</p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room™ podcast, <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> is joined by <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/hana-kahleova">Dr. Hana Kahleova</a> who shares a case study of a medical school student who was able to <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/health-nutrition/plant-based-diet-leads-crohns-disease-remission"> put his Crohn’s Disease into remission</a> by adopting a plant-based diet. Even with traditional medical treatments the student was still struggling until he made dietary adjustments.</p> <p>Dr. Kahleova and Chuck explore why his case may not be an anomaly and the nutrition science of why eliminating meat and dairy from the diet may the millions of others worldwide living with Crohn’s.</p> <p>Chuck is also joined by entrepreneur Gregg Rozeboom who was inspired to open a chain of plant-based restaurants that were both healthy and eco-friendly. Gregg simply wanted for there to be a place where he could feel good about the food that was being served. Thus, <a href="https://fruitive.com/">Fruitive</a> was born.</p> <p>Gregg’s journey to open Fruitive and adopt a plant-based diet is also part of his own health journey. He suffered from frequent and intense migraine headaches. At the suggestion of his wife, he began logging a food journal.

Thus, <a href="https://fruitive.com/">Fruitive</a> was born.</p> <p>Gregg’s journey to open Fruitive and adopt a plant-based diet is also part of his own health journey.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Are vegans really more likely to have a stroke than meat eaters? In this jam packed episode of The Exam Room Podcast™, <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/neal-barnard-md-facc">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joins <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> to debunk that myth and take a close look at a recent study that found that to be the case.</p> <p>As you’ll hear, the conclusion was drawn after researchers adjusted data from the study. Find out why this happened as Dr. Barnard sheds light on this method as well as a conversation he had with the authors of the study.</p> <p>You’ll also learn the difference between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes and how the risk differs for meat eaters compared to those who eat a plant-based diet.</p> <p>Then, Chuck is joined by <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/drostfeld/">Dr. Robert Ostfeld</a> to take a closer look at the health claims of the Atkins Diet. The low-carb, high fat diet is making a comeback thanks to a new wave of marketing. </p> <p>“As a cardiologist, I think the Atkins Diet is a mistake,” Ostfeld definitively stated.</p> <p>It’s a mistake he says that goes beyond an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.

Find out why this happened as Dr. Barnard sheds light on this method as well as a conversation he had with the authors of the study.</p> <p>You’ll also learn the difference between hemorrhagic and ischemic strokes and how the risk differs for meat eaters compared to those who eat a plant-based diet.</p> <p>Then, Chuck is joined by <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/drostfeld/">Dr. Robert Ostfeld</a> to take a closer look at the health claims of the Atkins Diet. The low-carb, high fat diet is making a comeback thanks to a new wave of marketing. </p> <p>“As a cardiologist, I think the Atkins Diet is a mistake,” Ostfeld definitively stated.</p> <p>It’s a mistake he says that goes beyond an increased risk of heart disease and cancer.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Your brain and your gut are like best friends who are always calling and texting each other. They’re always in communication and can’t live without each other!</p> <p>Gut and brain relationship expert Dr. Leigh Frame joins “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll on this episode of The Exam Room™ Podcast to shine more light on their unique bond. Her first appearance was one of the most downloaded episodes to date and Dr. Frame is back with even more science for her encore, including:</p> <ul> <li>Keto Diet’s effect on gut bacteria</li> <li>Why fiber is critical for gut health</li> <li>How gut bacteria changes with every meal</li> <li>Gut bacteria and mental health</li> <li>Phytonutrients in the gut and potential for heart disease and cancer prevention</li> </ul> <p>For inspiration, Chuck welcomes <a href= "http://www.bruceandmindy.com/">Bruce and Mindy Mylrea</a> to the show. The couple famously travel the world in the “<a href= "http://www.bruceandmindy.com/wellness-wagon/">Wellness Wagon</a>” — an RV that is covered with pictures of fruits and vegetables. They are on a mission to teach as many people as possible about the health benefits of a plant-based diet. And for them, it’s very personal.</p> <p>Bruce has been diagnosed with prostate cancer and continues to carefully monitor his health while still teaching as many people as possible. The couple speak openly and candidly about the challenges they are facing and why it’s important that they tackle them head-on with a positive attitude and unrelenting optimism.</p> <p>Eating a whole-food plant-based diet is a critical part of Bruce’s plan and he credits it immensely for helping him throughout the treatment process. He says he was able to nullify many of the side effects of the surgeries, radiation and hormone therapies because of his diet.</p> <p>This is a show you won’t want to miss!</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Gregory J.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Menopause is inescapable. From hot flashes to mood swings, every woman will eventually feel the effects of the change of life.

As you’ll hear, many of those patients have experienced incredible health transformations and have incredible success stories to share.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Ostfeld also discusses in depth why he views the <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/exam-room-podcast/keto-diet-myths-and-facts"> Keto Diet</a> as a medical mistake that can put your heart health at risk.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever gone to the doctor and been given this ambiguous prescription for “diet and exercise?” The exercise part seems straight forward, but for many doctors food remains a medical mystery.</p> <p> </p> <p>That’s a major problem given the fact that poor diet quality has surpassed smoking to become the leading cause of death and disability in the U.S. In fact, 70 percent of all chronic diseases are believed to be linked to diet and lifestyle.</p> <p> </p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room Podcast™, <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/neal-barnard-md-facc">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joins <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> to explore why doctors don’t know much about diets. As you’ll learn, the problem begins long before they ever enter practice, it begins in medical school. The lack of nutrition education in the curriculum is jaw-dropping despite an increasing amount of research showing that many chronic disease-related deaths could have been prevented by dietary changes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Barnard also shares how YOU can help fix the problem by speaking with your own doctors and help them understand that vitamin C comes from more than just a pill or glass of orange juice. Your conversations with them about nutrition and the benefits of a plant-based diet can literally help to save a life.</p> <p> </p> <p>And if you think your doctor won’t listen? Think again. A survey among physicians published in the <em><a href= "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2779722/">Journal of the American College of Nutrition</a></em> finds that 94 percent of them feel nutrition counseling should be part of primary care visits. However, only 14 percent feel like they are able to adequately talk about it, but your conversation can help change that.</p> <p> </p> <p>You’ll also get tips on how to begin those conversations and how to have them with friends and family who may be skeptical of a vegan diet.</p> <p> </p> <p>This episode originally aired on <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/NealBarnardMD/videos/667165910398544/">Facebook Live</a>.</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Follow</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> / <a href="http://twitter.com/drnealbarnard">@DrNealBarnard</a> / <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a></p> <p> </p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> / <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee/">@PhysiciansCommittee</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Share the Show</strong></p> <p> </p> <p>Please pass along what you’ve learned on the show by sharing it with a friend and by subscribing on <a href= "http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-exam-room-by-the-physicians-committee/id1312957138"> Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/6XElJTfdDQLQBd8Wm5BeOv?si=ImSV8rgHSXGOJvbEICIpTA"> Spotify</a> or many other podcast providers.

After retiring as an elite professional athlete and later hanging up the boots as a firefighter, he devoted his life to inspiring and improving the health of so many people through the plant-based Engine 2 Diet.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>It’s not just chicken that you’re eating!</p> <p> </p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room Podcast™, <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/neal-barnard-md-facc">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joins <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> to discuss the disgusting truth about chicken being sold in stores. It doesn’t matter if it’s white or dark meat – odds are it’s covered in feces! We know because we hired independent investigators to buy chicken from stores around the country and <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/blog/chicken-should-carry-feces-warning-label"> test it for the presence of fecal matter</a>. What they found was stomach churning!</p> <p> </p> <p>You’ll also learn the filthy facts about “<a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/blog/video-fecal-matter-grocery-store-chicken-too">fecal soup</a>.” It’s far from being good for the soul, but is found in poultry processing plants nationwide.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Barnard and Chuck also detail why the safety measures currently in place to prevent feces from contaminating your food are failing miserably.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/mark-kennedy">Mark Kennedy</a>, the Physicians Committee’s Vice President of Legal Affairs, tries to clean up the dirty talk by detailing a <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/doctors-sue-usda-ignoring-concerns-over-fecal-contamination-chicken"> lawsuit filed against the USDA</a> that is dominating headlines! The Washington Post, Fox News, USA Today, The Daily Mail, and dozens of other outlets are reporting on the Physicians Committee’s suit that seeks to force the agency to step up its game and stop ignoring concerns over fecal contamination.</p> <p> </p> <p>But poop isn’t the only concern when it comes to chicken. Dr. Steve Neabore returns to the show to discuss how cooking meat over an open flame causes cancer-causing compounds to form.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s not just chicken that you’re eating!</p> <p> </p> <p>On this episode of The Exam Room Podcast™, <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/neal-barnard-md-facc">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joins <a href= "https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> to discuss the disgusting truth about chicken being sold in stores. It doesn’t matter if it’s white or dark meat – odds are it’s covered in feces! We know because we hired independent investigators to buy chicken from stores around the country and <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/blog/chicken-should-carry-feces-warning-label"> test it for the presence of fecal matter</a>. What they found was stomach churning!</p> <p> </p> <p>You’ll also learn the filthy facts about “<a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/blog/video-fecal-matter-grocery-store-chicken-too">fecal soup</a>.” It’s far from being good for the soul, but is found in poultry processing plants nationwide.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dr. Barnard and Chuck also detail why the safety measures currently in place to prevent feces from contaminating your food are failing miserably.</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/mark-kennedy">Mark Kennedy</a>, the Physicians Committee’s Vice President of Legal Affairs, tries to clean up the dirty talk by detailing a <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/doctors-sue-usda-ignoring-concerns-over-fecal-contamination-chicken"> lawsuit filed against the USDA</a> that is dominating headlines! The Washington Post, Fox News, USA Today, The Daily Mail, and dozens of other outlets are reporting on the Physicians Committee’s suit that seeks to force the agency to step up its game and stop ignoring concerns over fecal contamination.</p> <p> </p> <p>But poop isn’t the only concern when it comes to chicken. Dr. Steve Neabore returns to the show to discuss how cooking meat over an open flame causes cancer-causing compounds to form. Plus, you’ll find out which meat has the highest levels of carcinogens.</p> <p> </p> <p>Follow</p> <p> </p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> / <a href="http://twitter.com/drnealbarnard">@DrNealBarnard</a> / <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a></p> <p> </p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> / <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee/">@PhysiciansCommittee</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Share the Show</p> <p> </p> <p>Please pass along what you’ve learned on the show by sharing it with a friend and by subscribing on <a href= "http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-exam-room-by-the-physicians-committee/id1312957138"> Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/6XElJTfdDQLQBd8Wm5BeOv?si=ImSV8rgHSXGOJvbEICIpTA"> Spotify</a> or many other podcast providers.

Thirty percent of total greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to food production with animal products accounting for the majority of that, according to leading scientific researchers. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg!</p> <p>Dr. Barnard and Chuck also review a study where researchers determined what would happen if everyone on the planet <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/health-nutrition/vegetarian-diets-best-environment-and-human-health"> adopted a plant-based diet by 2050</a>. What they found will not only help the environment and improve human health, but it can also save more than a trillion dollars.</p> <p>Then, Chuck sits down with Gwynn Whittaker who left a lucrative career in the IT and national security fields behind after prematurely losing her fiancé to heart attack. She now devotes her time to improving the health and quality of life others so they don’t have to suffer the same loss. Whittaker has opened a whole-food plant-based restaurant, <a href= "https://greenfare.com/">GreenFare Organic Café</a>, just outside Washington, D.C. where hundreds have completed the Physicians Committee’s 21-day Vegan Kickstart that is offered there. Many have gone from couch potatoes to avid marathoners and have significantly improved their chances of living a long and healthy life!</p> <p>Whittaker is also gearing up for <a href= "https://www.fairfaxvegfest.org/">Fairfax VegFest</a> on April 13 where Dr. Barnard, Dr. Jim Loomis, and Dr. T.

Whittaker has opened a whole-food plant-based restaurant, <a href= "https://greenfare.com/">GreenFare Organic Café</a>, just outside Washington, D.C. where hundreds have completed the Physicians Committee’s 21-day Vegan Kickstart that is offered there. Many have gone from couch potatoes to avid marathoners and have significantly improved their chances of living a long and healthy life!</p> <p>Whittaker is also gearing up for <a href= "https://www.fairfaxvegfest.org/">Fairfax VegFest</a> on April 13 where Dr. Barnard, Dr. Jim Loomis, and Dr. T. Colin Campbell will be speaking. Dietician and frequent guest of The Exam Room regular Lee Crosby will also be lecturing on ‘The Truth About Keto Diets’ and Chuck will be recording episodes of the podcast live!</p> <p>Follow</p> <p>Twitter: <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> / <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a> / <a href= "https://twitter.com/GreenFareCafe">@GreenFareCafe</a></p> <p>IG: <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a> / <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/physicianscommittee/">@PhysiciansCommittee</a> / <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/greenfarecafe/">@GreenFareCafe</a></p> <p>Share the Show</p> <p>Please pass along what you’ve learned on the show by sharing it with a friend and by subscribing on <a href= "http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-exam-room-by-the-physicians-committee/id1312957138"> Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href= "https://open.spotify.com/show/6XElJTfdDQLQBd8Wm5BeOv?si=ImSV8rgHSXGOJvbEICIpTA"> Spotify</a> or many other podcast providers.

What happened to the health and waistlines of participants over the course of a 16-week study was quite remarkable!</p> <p>Then Dr. Steve Neabore travels back in time to when Chuck still weighed 420 pounds to perform an examination. At that point, his uncontrolled blood pressure was 190/110 and he was first given medication to treat hypertension in high school. Cholesterol and blood sugar were also trending in the wrong direction as was his waist, which had expanded to 66 inches around.</p> <p>Dr. Neabore explains the metabolic damage being caused by the extreme high-fat diet and discusses exactly what is happening in the body as the chest begins to tighten and it becomes difficult to breathe even when taking just a few steps. What do the arteries look like at this point? How hard is the heart having to work?</p> <p>Then the focus turns to gut bacteria as Dr. Leigh Frame joins the show to talk about the wildly popular research that’s being done on microbiome. Scientists are finding that the link between health and the gut is even stronger than we thought thanks to advancements in DNA research. Fun fact: no two people have the exact same gut microbiome profile. So, what’s in your gut is as unique as your fingerprint.

The difference is amazing.</p> <p>Then, dietician <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/maggie-neola">Maggie Neola</a> returns to the show with a head-to-head comparison of some of America’s most popular foods. How does the fat and calories found in the traditional recipes compare to the equally tasty vegan versions?

			<title>Food Addiction: Why We Can’t Stop Eating</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Food addiction can be as powerful as any drug on the street.  In this episode of The Exam Room™, <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> opens up about a nearly three-decade battle with food addiction that nearly claimed his life. He struggled to “diet” at 420 pounds and experienced withdrawal symptoms when he tried to go without fast food. His body would ache, and he became filled will anger. At one point, he became so infuriated without his “fix” that he violently punched his fist through a wall before sneaking out in the middle of the night to find a 24-hour drive-thru and quiet the unrelenting rage.</p> <p>But why does this happen? <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/neal-barnard-md-facc">Dr. Neal Barnard</a> joins the show to explain how the brain reacts similarly to certain foods and narcotics. There is a reason that we crave high-fat and high-calorie foods. Our brain loves them! And it’s not just people like Chuck who reach 400 pounds or more. There are others who might appear healthy but can be a chocoholic or obsessed with bacon.</p> <p>Dr. Barnard reveals that the parallel between food and drug addiction is so great that a chocolate addict’s cravings can be reduced by Narcan, which is a medicine used to treat opioid overdoses.</p> <p>And what is it about cheese that makes it so hard to live without? There’s an opioid link there too!</p> <p>But the biggest question is how do you beat food addiction? How can you <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/doctors-launch-breakupwithbacon-campaign-dc"> break up with bacon</a> and give cheeseburgers the boot? Dr. Barnard and Chuck outline the steps you can take to kick the habit and reclaim your health.</p> <p>You’ll also hear from Sarah Fraser, who is a popular media personality in the Washington, DC area and host of the <a href= "http://heyfrase.com/">Hey Frase podcast</a>. Like Chuck, her battle with food addiction began at a young age and grew worse over time. She talks about overcoming the emotional hurt caused by body shaming and taking control of her weight by practicing mindful eating and turning to a plant-based diet.

At a time when we’re spending billions of dollars every year to lose weight only to get heavier and heavier, Dr. Greger clues us in on where we’re going wrong as he talks about his new book, <a href= "https://amzn.to/2tn1EUA">How Not To Diet</a>.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What foods are the best to fight a cold and the flu? That’s what this episode of The Exam Room™ is all about!</p> <p><a href="https://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> sits down with dietician <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/about-us/staff/maggie-neola">Maggie Neola</a> to discover that boosting the immune system goes well beyond just a high dose of vitamin C.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How healthy is a pumpkin? Super healthy! As it turns out, pumpkins are far more than just something fun to carve on Halloween. You can argue that they’re a nutrition powerhouse packed with vitamins proven to lower the risk of cancer, boost to the immune system, and help promote a healthy heart, lungs, and kidneys.</p> <p>Take a journey with <a href= "https://www.facebook.com/weightlosschampion/">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> to a pumpkin paradise and learn everything there is to know about these delicious fall favorites. He travels to <a href="https://www.butlersorchard.com/">Butler’s Orchard</a>, a 300-acre farm just outside of Washington, D.C. to speak with third-generation grower Ben Butler about picking the perfect pumpkin for both cooking and for carving. Plus, explore the growing process and take a trip inside of their massive farm store where you can find just about anything you want that’s made with pumpkin — even soap!</p> <p>You’ll also learn about dozens of varieties of pumpkins and how a lot of them are downright bizarre! Some look like red neon mushrooms while others look like giant peanuts and something out of an alien invasion!</p> <p>Dietitian <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/doctors-and-staff/lee-crosby-rd-ld"> Lee Crosby</a> also carves up pumpkin nutrition facts! Everything from beta-carotene to vitamins A and C to fiber and tryptophan (yes, that thing that makes you sleepy) is on the table! </p> <p>Fun fact: The can of pumpkin in your pantry may not actually be pumpkin at all.

It is critically important that we continue searching for a cure, but he says there should also be an increased emphasis on preventing the disease.

			<title>How To Cook Without Oil</title>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Cooking without oil is a new practice for many of us. Who hasn’t been taught to add a splash of it to the pan before turning on the stove? And what about adding a spoonful to boiling water when making pasta? Indeed, whether it’s olive, vegetable or any other type of oil, it just seems to be in every recipe in the book.</p> <p>Since all oils are high in fat (1 gram of fat has nine calories) can be a problem for those trying to lose weight and maintain their overall health. Research also shows oil poses a significant risk to diabetics as it interferes with insulin’s ability to <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/health/health-topics/diet-and-diabetes-recipes-for-success"> move glucose into the cells</a>.</p> <p>So, how can you cook without it?! <a href= "https://www.instagram.com/chuckcarrollwlc">“The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll</a> and welcomes plant-based chef <a href= "https://dreenaburton.com/">Dreena Burton</a> to the show for a lesson. Dreena has collaborated with Dr. Neal Barnard on a number of projects, including his <a href= "https://pcrm1.ultracartstore.com/shop/Books/COOK-203.html">Cookbook For Reversing Diabetes</a>.</p> <p>Plus, in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Chuck revisits an interview with dietician <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/barnard-medical-center/doctors-and-staff/lee-crosby-rd-ld"> Lee Crosby, R.D., L.D.</a> from an episode titled <a href= "https://www.pcrm.org/podcast/meat-cancer-connection">The Meat-Cancer Connection</a>.</p> <p><em>For Lee Crosby, R.D., L.D., the connection between meat and cancer hits close to home. The Barnard Medical Center dietician shares her own story of finding a lump in her breast at a young age and turning to a plant-based diet as a result. Following the dietary changes the mass showed no signs of growth. As time passed, she reverted back to the standard American diet only to have the lump quickly grow. The mass was then removed and now she’s now devoted 100 percent to a plant-based diet.

How could that be?!</p> <p><br /> The Physicians Committee’s legal ace Mark Kennedy joins “The Weight Loss Champion” Chuck Carroll and reveals the staggering truth behind government ties to the dairy industry. It’s no conspiracy theory, it’s fact! You’ll learn how government-funded employees are working with companies like McDonald’s to find ways to get you to eat more cheese! It’s HUGE business.</p> <p><br /> Just how unhealthy is it?! Extremely! Barnard Medical Center registered dietitian Aly Luning explains that by taking dairy off your plate, you can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes and cut the chances of being diagnosed with certain cancers by more than 70 percent!</p> <p><br /> Plus, that whole idea about needing milk for calcium and vitamin D pretty much goes out the window!</p> <p><br /> Follow: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a> / <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a></p> <p><br /> Podcast website: <a href= "http://www.pcrm.org/podcast">http://www.pcrm.org/podcast</a></p> <p><br /> Previous episodes: <a href= "https://apple.co/2DIVaQ4">https://apple.co/2DIVaQ4</a></p>]]></description>

It’s no conspiracy theory, it’s fact! You’ll learn how government-funded employees are working with companies like McDonald’s to find ways to get you to eat more cheese! It’s HUGE business.</p> <p> Just how unhealthy is it?! Extremely! Barnard Medical Center registered dietitian Aly Luning explains that by taking dairy off your plate, you can significantly reduce your risk of heart disease and diabetes and cut the chances of being diagnosed with certain cancers by more than 70 percent!</p> <p> Plus, that whole idea about needing milk for calcium and vitamin D pretty much goes out the window!</p> <p> Follow: <a href="http://www.twitter.com/pcrm">@PCRM</a> / <a href= "http://www.twitter.com/chuckcarrollwlc">@ChuckCarrollWLC</a></p> <p> Podcast website: <a href= "http://www.pcrm.org/podcast">http://www.pcrm.org/podcast</a></p> <p> Previous episodes: <a href= "https://apple.co/2DIVaQ4">https://apple.co/2DIVaQ4</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
